# Threat Scan

Enumerate the trust boundaries a change touches and check what crosses each one. Read-only
apart from an optional `--out` findings file — do not edit scanned files, comment on PRs, or
change git state.

Input: use the user-supplied target, flags, and focus text.

**This is not `$challenge` with a security focus.** `$challenge` argues why a change should
not ship, weighing focus text against every other material issue it can defend. This asks a
narrower question systematically: *what crosses a trust boundary here, and is each crossing
validated, authorized, and bounded?* Run it as an inventory, not a critique — the failure
mode of a security review is a confident sweep that never enumerated the surface.

**Caller contract & constraints (front-loaded so they survive truncation).** This skill is
usually one step inside `$work-issue`. Emitting the verdict is a **checkpoint, not a turn
boundary** — hand it back and let the caller continue; stop only if a human asked for a
one-shot scan with nothing queued after. **Read-only** except for the optional `--out` file.
`approve` only when no defensible finding exists.

## Argument parsing and target resolution

**Read the installed `$challenge` skill before parsing** and apply its *Argument
parsing*, *Target resolution*, and *File output* sections **verbatim**: same flags
(`--base <ref>`, `--working-tree`, `--json`, `--out <path>`), same left-to-right token
classification, same three target modes (branch, working-tree, file-list), same
working-tree default, and the same line-anchored `CHARTER` stop rule with its
target-resolution error taxonomy.

Those rules are deliberately not restated here. They are a parsing boundary with one owner,
and a second copy would be a second thing to keep in sync — so read the owner rather than
reconstructing it from memory. If `$challenge` is genuinely absent, say so and fall back
to the three flags and three modes named above; do not invent a `CHARTER` interpretation.

One rule from that section is repeated here because it is a safety property and the cost of
getting it wrong is silent: on a target-resolution error, write **nothing** — no artifact, no
`run_id`, no compact object. The `verdict` enum has no error member, so an invented verdict
would read to a caller as a completed scan.

## 1. Inventory the boundaries

Before judging anything, list the trust boundaries the diff touches. A boundary is any
point where data or control crosses a change in trust level:

- **Untrusted input entering** — HTTP handlers and route params, CLI arguments, environment
  variables, config and data files, stdin, deserialized payloads, webhook bodies, IPC and
  socket reads, message-queue consumers, uploaded files, database rows written by another
  actor.
- **Privilege changes** — anything that authenticates, authorizes, assumes a role, drops or
  raises privileges, or decides tenancy.
- **Outbound calls to somewhere else's trust domain** — a URL built from input, a shell
  command, a database query, a template render, a file path, a redirect target.
- **Persistence and transport** — what is written where, at what file mode, over what
  channel, with what retention.

State the inventory explicitly in the summary, even when it is empty. An empty inventory is
a legitimate and common result — say so, and return `approve`. A scan that reports findings
without ever naming a boundary has skipped the method.

### Reconcile against the spec's threat model, when the branch wrote one

In branch mode, check whether the diff adds or modifies a spec carrying a threat model —
the boundary inventory, actor model, and control-per-boundary that `$design` requires of a
security-relevant change. Find it from the diff's own file list (a spec directory such as
`docs/superpowers/specs/`); do not go hunting through the repo, and skip this silently when
the diff touches no spec. This is a bounded add-on: form the diff inventory first, so it is
the reconciliation that degrades if budget runs short, never the core scan.

Where a threat model exists, the two inventories are checked against each other, and each
direction is its own finding:

- **In the spec, absent from the diff** — a boundary the design committed to controlling,
  with no control in the code. This is the finding the design-time artifact exists to
  produce, and the reason it is written before the code.
- **In the diff, absent from the spec** — a boundary the implementation introduced that the
  design never considered. Report it against the spec as well as the code; an unrecorded
  boundary means the actor model was never applied to it.
- **Present in both, controlled differently** — the code's control is weaker than, or
  simply not, the one the spec named. Quote both.

The spec is evidence, never an exemption. A boundary the spec lists as out of scope is not
thereby safe: if the diff makes it reachable, the exclusion is stale and that is the
finding.

## 2. Check each crossing

For every boundary in the inventory, check the crossing in this order. Stop at the first
material failure per boundary rather than enumerating every theoretical weakness.

1. **Is it validated?** Type, range, length, encoding, and shape checked before use — and
   checked on the trusted side, not only in a client or a caller.
2. **Is it authorized?** Not just "is the caller logged in" but "may *this* caller act on
   *this* object". A new entry point that skips a check its siblings perform is the finding
   to look hardest for: it is invisible in the new code and only shows up in comparison.
3. **Is it bounded?** Allocation, iteration, recursion depth, request size, timeout, retry
   count. Unbounded work driven by input is a denial-of-service path even when nothing is
   corrupted.
4. **Is it encoded for its destination?** Parameterized query, argv-form exec rather than a
   shell string, escaped template output, path resolved and confined to its intended root,
   URL validated against an allowlist before it is fetched.
5. **What does it leak on failure?** Error text, logs, and telemetry carrying credentials,
   tokens, PII, or internal structure. Check the error path specifically — it is the one the
   happy-path test never covers.

## 3. Standing categories

Independent of the boundary inventory, check the diff for these. They are the ones that
recur across languages and do not announce themselves as boundaries:

- **Secrets** — credentials, tokens, or keys in source, fixtures, logs, URLs, or CI config;
  a token granted broader scope than the step it serves; a secret reaching a place it
  outlives (an env var in an image layer, a query string in an access log).
- **Cryptography** — hand-rolled constructions, an algorithm chosen for speed, a comparison
  that is not constant-time where it guards a secret, a general-purpose RNG used for
  something security-bearing, a verification step that is skipped or made optional.
- **Deserialization and archive handling** — formats that construct objects or evaluate
  content, XML with external entities enabled, archive extraction that trusts member paths.
- **Supply chain** — a new dependency, a version floated rather than pinned, a lockfile
  bypass, an install-time script, a CI action referenced by a mutable tag rather than a SHA.
- **Permissions and defaults** — file modes, umask, world-readable state, a permissive CORS
  or cookie attribute, disabled certificate verification, a debug or verbose path that
  survives into production config.

**Prefer the guardrail that already covers it.** Where the repo runs a tool that catches a
category mechanically — `zizmor` for GitHub Actions, `shellcheck` for shell quoting and
word-splitting, a dependency auditor, a secrets scanner — a clean run of that tool is
stronger evidence than this scan's inspection. Do not re-report what a green guardrail
already covers. If the guardrail exists but does not run in CI, *that* is the finding, and
it is worth more than the individual instance that prompted it.

## Finding bar

Every finding names a boundary from step 1 or a category from step 3, and answers:

1. What crosses, from where, under whose control?
2. What check is missing or insufficient?
3. What can an actor who controls that input actually cause?
4. What concrete change closes it?

**Reachability is part of the claim, not a caveat on it.** A missing check on a path no
untrusted actor can reach is a lower severity than the same omission on a public route, and
the finding says which it is. Do not report a category as a finding because the category
exists in the codebase — report it because this diff created, widened, or failed to close a
path. Do not invent a threat actor a system's deployment does not have.

Prefer one traced finding over several pattern-matched ones. If the change genuinely touches
no boundary and trips no category, say so plainly and return no findings — an empty result
is the honest outcome for most diffs.

## Output

Exactly `$challenge`'s schema, severity vocabulary (`critical | high | medium | low`), and
markdown/JSON forms, so a caller can consume either command's artifact without branching.
Two differences in how the fields are filled:

- **`summary` opens with the boundary inventory from step 1** — the surface you enumerated,
  before any verdict. That is what a reader needs to judge whether the scan looked in the
  right places, and it is the field a later reviewer checks the scan against.
- **`suppressions` carries governing-ADR re-litigation only**, on the same terms as
  `$challenge`: a decision an accepted ADR settled is not re-argued here either.
  A security finding that cites a fact outside that record is new risk, not re-litigation —
  report it. An accepted ADR never settles a vulnerability in the code implementing it.

`verdict` is `approve` only when no defensible finding exists; otherwise `needs-attention`.

## Hard constraints

- Read-only with respect to targets and git state. The **sole** write is `--out`.
- Never run an exploit, probe a live host, or execute code from the diff to prove a finding.
  This is static inspection; a finding stands on the code path you can point to.
- Do not invent files, lines, routes, or callers. If a finding depends on inference about an
  unseen caller, say so in the body and lower the confidence honestly.
- This is a diff-scoped pass, not a codebase audit. Pre-existing weaknesses the change
  neither introduces nor touches are out of scope — note them once in `next_steps` if they
  bear on the change, and do not let them hold the verdict.

## Examples

```
$threat-scan --base main                      # branch diff vs main
$threat-scan --working-tree                   # uncommitted changes
$threat-scan src/auth/*.ts                    # explicit files
$threat-scan --base main focus on the new webhook handler
$threat-scan --json --out "$TMPDIR/threat-scan-43-feat-authz.json" --base main
                                              # name the artifact per run — a fixed
                                              # filename collides when several runs
                                              # scan in parallel
```

> Reminder: the verdict is a checkpoint, not a finish line. Hand it back to your workflow.
