name: campaign
description: "Orchestrate a set of GitHub issues until each is closed as already fixed or resolved by a merged pull request, including triage, dependency planning, per-issue execution, serial merging, and newly discovered work. Use when asked to run a campaign, clear an issue set, or drive a batch of issues to done."
---

Drive a batch of GitHub issues to completion — each issue either closed (already fixed) or merged (fixed by a PR).

**Single continuous task.** This is one task from start to final merge. Checkpoints (triage done, CI green, PR merged) are not turn boundaries. End only when the queue is empty or you hit a **global** blocker (dirty tree, missing auth). Issue-local blockers don't stop the batch — mark them blocked and continue.

**Authorization.** Invoking `$campaign` authorizes you to auto-close issues shown as already-fixed and self-merge green + mergeable PRs. This authorization stays with you — never propagate merge rights to subagents. Each `$work-issue` stops at a green + mergeable PR; you handle the merge.

## 1. Resolve the Issue Set

Parse the user's selector into issue numbers. Support:
- Explicit numbers: `992 994 1001`
- Ranges: `992-997` (inclusive; skip non-existent)
- Natural language: `open issues labeled bug` — paginate manually, never `--paginate` (unbounded). Pass the search string and cursor as GraphQL variables — never interpolate into the query literal, since qualifiers like `label:"good first issue"` carry quotes that break the string: `gh api graphql -f q='repo:<owner>/<repo> is:open is:issue <terms>' -f query='query($q: String!, $endCursor: String) { search(query: $q, type: ISSUE, first: 100, after: $endCursor) { pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor } nodes { ... on Issue { number labels(first: 100) { nodes { name } } } } } }'`. Loop while `hasNextPage`, re-running with `-f endCursor=<cursor>` (omit it on the first page), max 5 pages. Then probe once with `first:1` and the fifth cursor — a returned node means >500 matches: fail with "selector too broad; use explicit numbers or narrow the query". The `repo:` qualifier scopes results, so per-node repo validation is unnecessary

Drop `epic`-labeled issues from the set (report the drop). NL selectors get labels from the GraphQL result; for explicit/range paths, fetch labels to check this. Apply the same filter to new matches during resume reconciliation — never enqueue an epic.

Any trailing text after the selector is **completion notes** — context on what "done" means. Carry these through as **private dispatch context**: they flow verbatim into subagent prompts only, never onto public GitHub surfaces. When notes are present, derive a **public-safe summary** once, here (strip private context, host paths, credentials), and record it in the manifest as `Public-safe notes`. Acceptance criteria, `WORK:` annotations, comments, and PR bodies use only the summary. If you cannot derive a confident public-safe summary, stop and ask the user to supply one before proceeding.

**Resolve `campaign_root` before any writes.** It's the main repo root (not current directory, which might be a worktree):

```bash
campaign_root=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

Use `"$campaign_root/..."` for all reads/writes — a bare `.agent/campaigns/...` from a worktree creates a forked manifest.

**Initialize the manifest** (find-or-create, never blind-create). Key it on a **selector identity stable across runs**:
- For explicit numbers/ranges: sorted deduped requested numbers (before the "skip non-existent" filter)
- For NL selectors: lowercased, whitespace-collapsed query string
- For mixed selectors: sorted numbers + normalized query (deterministic order)

Slug is a short hash of this normal form. Store the full normal form in the manifest as `Normalized-selector`. Use `"$campaign_root/.agent/campaigns/<slug>.md"`.

**Hash collision handling:** On any file match, confirm loaded `Normalized-selector` equals this run's. On mismatch, use `<slug>-2.md`, etc.

**Keep manifest out of git** without relying on target repo's `.gitignore`** (required before any manifest write or resume mutation**):

```bash
# Check if ignore file is tracked
git -C "$campaign_root" ls-files --error-unmatch .agent/.gitignore  # exit 0=tracked, 1=untracked, other=error
```

- Exit 0 (tracked): leave alone, but verify it ignores `.agent/campaigns/`
- Exit 1 (untracked): create dir, write `*` to `.agent/.gitignore` via temp file in `$campaign_root/.agent/` then rename, with EXIT trap to clean temp on interruption; clear trap only after rename succeeds
- Other: stop with named blocker

Verify: `git -C "$campaign_root" check-ignore -q .agent/campaigns/`. Stop if fails.

**Routing:**
- **No file** → create with `Status: active`
- **File with `Status: active`** → **resume**: load it, skip init, don't overwrite non-`pending` rows. Manifests written before the `Public-safe notes` field existed lack it — backfill before validation: derive the summary from the stored `Completion notes` (`none` when notes are `none`; ask the user when safe derivation is impossible) and write the manifest back atomically. For NL selectors, reconcile live resolved set against loaded queue — enqueue new matches. If completion notes differ, surface and confirm; on confirmed change, re-derive the public-safe summary and update the manifest.
- **File with `Status: complete`** → archive as `<slug>-done-<timestamp>.md`, create fresh

**You are the only writer.** Subagents reference manifest facts by value (copied into prompts), never write it. Write atomically (temp + rename).

**Edits are surgical, never `replace_all`.** A `replace_all` edit keyed on a too-short match string rewrites every row containing it, silently flipping rows outside the current edit. Match on the full unique row (issue number + status), not a substring. Re-read the manifest after each edit to confirm only the intended row changed; if not, stop with a named blocker before any further write or GitHub action.

**Validate manifest before use:** required fields present, issue rows unique, states recognized (`pending|triaged|in-flight|ready-to-merge|merged|closed|blocked`), table structure valid. Stop with blocker on failure.

Manifest schema:

```

Status progression: `pending → triaged → in-flight → merged | closed | blocked`

## 2. Environment Discovery

Run `$preflight` **once** for the batch to get `BASE_BRANCH`, guardrail commands, gh auth, and ADR-index coupling (`coupled` | `not coupled` | `no index`). Record these in the manifest. On resume, read from manifest and skip re-running (re-confirm auth and clean tree only). Stop on blockers before touching issues.

## 3. Triage

**Reconcile state first.** Read the manifest before anything else.

For each queued issue, check for artifacts from prior runs:
- **Already closed** → done; drop without re-closing
- **`status:` label set** → map to campaign state: `ready`/`needs-triage` → `pending` (triage); `in-progress`/`in-review` → `in-flight` (reconcile artifacts); `awaiting-merge` → verify PR then `ready-to-merge`; `blocked`/`needs-human` → `blocked`. Treat closed as authoritative regardless of label.
- **Existing PR green + mergeable** → mark `ready-to-merge`, carry to step 4
- **Persisted step-4 assignments exist** → read them back, don't re-derive
- **Existing branch/PR incomplete** → **recover branch first**: if a PR exists, resolve its number from the issue link, then `gh pr view <PR> --json headRefName`; else match `feat/<short-slug>-<issue-number>` in `git branch` or `git ls-remote --heads origin` (full shape, not `*-<n>` suffix — #1 must not match ...-11). Persist to manifest. **PR-linked branch → reuse by default** (the PR explicitly names it, satisfying `$work-issue`'s reuse rule). **Convention-only branch → ask the user** reuse-or-restart before dispatch, and carry the operator's decision in the prompt. Deleting any branch requires explicit user confirmation
- **No artifacts** → triage normally

**Dispatch read-only triage subagents** (up to 5 parallel). Each prompt carries completion notes verbatim (private dispatch context — safe inside prompts). Subagent investigates issue body, linked PRs/commits, and current code. Return only:

- **verdict**: `close-candidate` | `fix` (subtype: `trivial-bugfix` | `governed-small-change` | `non-trivial`)
- **evidence**: citations (`file:line`, commit SHA, PR number)
- **rationale**: ≤300 tokens explaining why

For `governed-small-change`, also return: decision reference, kind, accepted status, governed behavior, testable acceptance criteria. These are evidence, not authority — `$work-issue` revalidates.

Pick model by signals: clearly mechanical → fast model; ambiguous/wide-surface → capable model.

**Verdict handling:**
- `close-candidate` → confirm with `bug-claim-verifier` or `$challenge` before closing. **Confirmed** → keep `close-candidate`; don't close here — batch closes in step 4 after plan is visible. **Rejected or inconclusive** → the already-fixed claim is unproven, so the issue needs work: re-verdict as `fix` (subtype from the verifier's evidence; default `non-trivial` when unclear), or `blocked` with reason if even that can't be determined. Persist the transition in the manifest before presenting the plan.
- `fix` → subtype drives model selection in step 4. Cheap-model `trivial-bugfix`/`governed-small-change` is a floor; escalate if fix proves subtler.

Record verdicts in manifest `Verdict` column. Reconcile states (`ready-to-merge`, already-closed) live in `Status`.

## 4. Plan the Fix Batch

Count issues needing fixes. **Every fix runs in a subagent** — never inline.

**Wave size:**
- **Serial (size 1)**: for coupled issues (overlapping file scopes, ordering dependencies). Merge each before next.
- **Parallel (up to 5)**: for independent issues (disjoint scopes, no dependencies).

Record wave in manifest (`Wave` column): `s1`, `s2`... for serial (order = merge order), `w1`, `w2`... for parallel.

**Pre-assign ADR/migration numbers and file scope** even for serial — crashed issues need consistent numbers on re-dispatch. Persist these in manifest. File scope is a hint, not guarantee.

Present triage/plan table: issue → verdict, wave, assigned numbers, file scope.

Execute **close-candidates** (all remaining ones are confirmed — rejected/inconclusive candidates were re-routed in step 3): post research comment citing fixing code/PR, `gh issue close` each. Set `Status: closed`, append to outcomes log before removing from queue.

## 5. Execute Fixes

When issue goes **in-flight**, flip status and **read back the actual branch name** from subagent report or `gh pr view --json headRefName`. Record in `Branch` column. Don't pre-assign — `$work-issue` derives its own `feat/<short-slug>-<n>`.

**Every fix is a subagent running `$work-issue <n>` to green + mergeable PR, then stopping.** Subagent must reflect the **public-safe summary** of the completion notes — never the verbatim notes — in acceptance criteria and PR body. No merge authorization to subagents. Subagent report (per `AGENTS.md`): ~1-2k token summary with outcome, branch/PR ref, files touched, guardrail status, blockers. No diffs/logs/file bodies.

Each prompt carries:
- Issue number, acceptance criteria, **completion notes verbatim** (private dispatch context) and the **public-safe summary** (the only form allowed on public surfaces: acceptance criteria, `WORK:` annotations, PR bodies)
- **For resumed work:** recovered branch name and `reuse` decision
- For `governed-small-change`: subtype, decision reference, kind, accepted status, governed behavior, criteria
- Assigned ADR/migration numbers, file scope
- Guardrail commands, `BASE_BRANCH`, ADR-index coupling verdict
- Model tier from triage
- (Parallel only) external worktree path (`../<repo>-worktrees/<branch>`)

**Serial:** dispatch one, wait for green + mergeable PR, merge (step 6), repeat.

**Parallel:** dispatch up to 5 worktree-isolated subagents in single message per wave.

**Poll every outstanding row**, serial and parallel alike — a wave of one stalls the whole campaign. A dispatched agent is silent for long stretches by design — a design phase, a build, a review loop, a CI wait — so silence is not a signal, and last-commit age cannot tell alive from dead. Two things can, and they answer different questions:

- **Has it moved?** `$work-issue` publishes its phase boundaries to the tracker as it goes, and they land in three clusters rather than five checkpoints: `status:in-progress` with `WORK:SCOPE` at the start, `status:in-review` once the build is done, then the PR and its `WORK:REVIEW` (that one on the PR, not the issue) at ship. Take the newest such event on the row and read its age — the github-tracking skill carries the label-timeline recipe, and `--json comments` carries each annotation's own `createdAt` (the top-level field is the issue's, which never moves). Design, build and review each sit inside a cluster gap, so this narrows which rows look interesting; it never says a row is dead, and it does not gate the probe below.
- **Is it alive?** Message the agent directly. A reply of any content proves it alive; nothing weaker does. The probe is non-destructive — it costs a live agent one turn — so a row quiet for roughly ten minutes is worth probing even though most such rows are healthy. A probe has failed when no reply arrives by the next poll: an agent inside a long tool call answers at its next turn boundary, not on demand.

Poll when an end-of-run notification arrives or when other work in hand finishes. When nothing else is in hand, the outstanding rows **are** the work: wait on them from a single background task and read it when it returns. Never a foreground sleep loop, and never a poll manufactured to look busy.

**Only an observed end of run authorizes re-dispatch.** Re-dispatching a live agent lands two branches and two PRs on one issue, which is worse than the stall you are fixing, so the bar is what you saw and not what you inferred. Unanswered probes are not proof. A row that has gone quiet, has not answered a probe across two polls, and shows no new tracker event is a **hold** — name it in your run output and keep draining the rest of the queue. A hold here is a report, not a state machine: nothing is written down, the tracker half is recomputed from live queries in seconds, and the probe half belongs to the run the operator is already in. Unlike step 6's hold this one writes no `status:` label and leaves the row **in-flight** — the label is the dispatched agent's to write, it may still be alive to write it, and a `blocked` row would read as drained while its agent kept working.

The operator's answer to that hold is what reaches the harness's stop control. Told to re-dispatch, stop the agent, wait for its end-of-run notification, and dispatch only then.

**A re-dispatch resumes where it can and restarts where it cannot.** Reconcile the row's artifacts first (step 3) — a dying agent may have pushed a branch or opened a PR you have not recorded. A row where that turns up no branch has nothing to resume; dispatch it fresh. Otherwise hand the successor the context it had before plus the recovered branch name, an explicit `reuse` decision, and the last phase the events showed. The branch carries the committed work by reference, so do not paste a diff into the prompt — bulky going in, stale on arrival. Reclaim the dead agent's worktree before dispatching: it still has the branch checked out, so the successor's own `git worktree add` on that path fails until you either hand it that path or remove it, and any uncommitted edits stranded there are readable only until you do.

**Report each poll as one table**, no prose per row. `State` is one of `alive`, `quiet`, `hold`, `ended`:

| Issue | Branch | Last signal | PR | State |
|-------|--------|-------------|----|-------|
| #NNN  | feat/… | `WORK:SCOPE` 6m | — | alive |

## 6. Merge

**Verify each issue's PR before merging it.** Green + mergeable says CI passed and Git can fast-forward — neither says the PR contains the work you dispatched. Two `gh` queries answer that; if either fails twice, hold rather than merge, since the merge is the irreversible half. (Your own ADR-index PR below has no issue and no manifest row, so none of this applies to it.)

- **The PR must close its assigned issue** — `gh pr view <PR> --json closingIssuesReferences`. A reference to any *other* issue takes the hold below: merging closes a row the campaign may still have queued, and a later resume reads that close as already-fixed. A missing reference is recorded and left to the post-merge auto-close check below.
- **List its changed files** — `gh pr diff <PR> --name-only`, on every PR, including a row step 3 adopted with no scope assigned; that PR has no subagent report behind it, so the list is worth more there, not less. Never `gh pr view --json files`: that field returns the first 100 paths and says nothing about the rest, so it reports a clean prefix of the largest PRs. A diff that succeeded and listed nothing blocks — nothing was changed, so nothing can be carrying the fix.
- **Compare that list against the issue's `File scope` cell from step 4.** A path is in scope when the cell names it, names a directory above it, or holds a glob whose directory is above it. A cell still at `—`, or holding nothing that parses as a path, leaves nothing to compare — record that and read every path through the next bullet, rather than treating an absent hint as a mismatch.
- **Paths outside the scope do not block by themselves.** Step 4 assigns scope as a hint, and a correct fix routinely touches a file the plan didn't predict; a check that hard-blocks on any deviation fires on legitimate work and gets routed around. A path is accounted for when the PR body, a commit message, or the subagent's report ties it to **the assigned issue**, or when this step itself mandated the change (the ADR index under `coupled` coupling, your own branch refresh, your own artifact regeneration). Everything else is **unrelated** — hold that one merge for the operator's decision. A path tied to a *different* tracked issue most needs that decision rather than being exempt from it: merging it lands a sibling's work early and can auto-close a row still queued. Never split, revert, or cherry-pick inside the PR; that surgery is undefined here and risks discarding work.

Whether the PR *implements* its issue is not what any of this answers: the reference says which issue it claims, the list says where it landed. Read the PR body, its acceptance criteria, and the `WORK:REVIEW` summary — but hold only on the triggers above, never on an unstated inability to confirm, or every reviewed PR becomes an operator's problem.

**A hold is a report, not a state machine.** Name the PR and the offending paths in your run output, take the blocker path (step 8), and keep draining the rest of the queue; the operator decides in the run. Don't persist that decision for a later one — the comparison is stateless and recomputed from `gh pr diff --name-only` and the scope cell in seconds, so a resumed campaign re-derives the hold rather than reading it back, and a release token durable enough to survive a resume is one any commenter on a public repo could post. Re-check `mergeStateStatus` before acting on the operator's answer: a blocked row drops out of the branch refresh below while its siblings keep merging, so a held PR does not stay mergeable.

As each issue reaches green + mergeable, run `$merge-cleanup` (you are authorized). Its "After a merge" list is written for a run cleaning up after itself, so **its worktree-removal and branch-deletion steps are replaced by the gated list at the end of this step** — the worktree here is not yours. Everything else in that skill still applies, and two parts of it are load-bearing here: its tracking writes and cleared-dependency reconcile, which nothing below fully repeats; and its switch to `BASE_BRANCH` and fast-forward pull, which are what keep your local base current for the refresh below and get you off the branch before you delete it. Merge one PR, then for each remaining in-flight PR re-check `mergeStateStatus`. If `BEHIND`/`DIRTY`, merge `BASE_BRANCH` into PR branch, regenerate artifacts, rerun guardrails, re-confirm green. If the repo forbids merge commits (linear history) and rebasing a pushed branch is denied, stop with a named blocker.

**In parallel mode the dispatched agent may still be running.** It stops at hand-off, and hand-off comes some way after its PR first reads green + mergeable — which is the moment you start merging — so the branch is usually still checked out in a worktree you did not create. Merging is unaffected: it touches only refs already pushed. The refresh above is — `git worktree add` on a branch checked out elsewhere fails. Refresh a `BEHIND` sibling only once you have observed that agent's end of run — or once `git worktree list` shows the branch checked out nowhere, which is the same fact for a row you did not dispatch. The cheaper route is to ask the live agent to do the refresh itself; that is the work it was already doing when this race was found.

The end of run does not by itself hand you the branch. The worker never removes its own worktree, so the branch is still checked out there after it stops, and your `git worktree add` still fails. **Reclaim it first**, exactly as step 5 does before a re-dispatch: take over the agent's existing path, or remove that worktree and then add your own. Only then check out the branch, or re-dispatch a subagent with the same context. Use step-4 assignments for artifact regeneration.

**ADR index handling** (three states: `coupled` | `not coupled` | `no index`):
- **`no index`**: skip row handling entirely
- **`not coupled`** (index exists, not CI-gated): subagents write only ADR file, report `index row pending`. You append all pending rows **once** after wave's last PR merges, on its own branch.
- **`coupled`** (index is CI-gated): subagents add their own rows in their PRs. You resolve adjacent-insertion conflicts during the serial-merge branch refresh. Expect no `index row pending` reports.

Verify auto-close: `gh issue view <n> --json state` after merge. If still open, close explicitly and note why. Record outcome in manifest before moving to next PR.

**Cleanup waits on the same signal re-dispatch does: an observed end of run for the agent that owns the branch and worktree.** A merged PR proves the work landed; it does not prove the agent stopped, and removing a worktree its owner is still `cd`-ed into surfaces as `fatal: Unable to read current working directory` out of that agent's next push. Nothing weaker counts — not a green check, not `WORK:REVIEW`, and not an answered probe, which proves the agent *alive* and so can only ever tell you to wait. What counts is the harness's end-of-run notification for that agent, or your own stop through the harness's stop control followed by that notification: the same two things step 5 accepts, for the same reason.

**The precondition binds to an agent this run dispatched.** A row you adopted on resume with its PR already open, and a row whose cleanup an earlier run deferred, have no such agent and never will — waiting on a notification that cannot arrive leaks them permanently. For those, observe instead — `git worktree list` first, then one of two cases: **either** no worktree holds the branch, so there is nobody to disturb, **or** the one that holds it reports an empty `git status --porcelain`, so nobody was working in it. Both are readable before anything is removed, which is the point: a precondition you can only settle by performing the removal it authorizes is not a precondition. Anything else defers.

With that satisfied, clean the row up in this order:

1. **Confirm the branch actually landed** — fetch, then `git merge-base --is-ancestor <branch> origin/<BASE_BRANCH>`. Required, and the liveness check does not make it redundant: an agent can end having left a commit that never landed, which is exactly what the observed incident produced. Do **not** use `git diff <BASE_BRANCH> <branch>` — that is a symmetric tree comparison, so a *sibling's* merge into the base makes it non-empty for a branch that landed perfectly, and deferred rows are precisely the ones swept after later merges. A squash or rebase merge rewrites the commits and defeats ancestry; there the evidence is **containment in the merged head**, `git merge-base --is-ancestor <branch> <headRefOid>` for the `headRefOid` from `gh pr view <PR> --json headRefOid`. Containment, not equality: a local tip *behind* the merged head is ordinary — a reviewer commits a suggestion in the web interface, and a plain fetch never fast-forwards the local branch — and everything that tip holds is in the pull request, while a tip carrying commits the pull request does not still fails. Match on the branch *name* alone — `gh pr list --head <branch> --state merged` — and this degrades to a no-op here, because you just merged that PR for that branch, so it always hits and waves through the one case the check exists for. Neither test satisfied → leave the row `merged`, put it in the deferred list, and delete nothing.
2. **Remove the worktree** — `git worktree remove`, never `--force`. It refuses on a worktree holding modified or untracked files, and a finished worker's routinely holds some. Treat the refusal as a skip rather than something to force past: put the row in the deferred list below and leave its branch with it.
3. **Delete the branch** — worktree first, since a branch checked out in one cannot be deleted, and that includes your own checkout: `$merge-cleanup`'s switch to `BASE_BRANCH` has to have happened, or a serial row whose subagent worked in the main checkout refuses here. Do not read `git branch -d` as a second land check: it tests against the branch's own upstream when it has one and against your current `HEAD` otherwise, never against `origin/<BASE_BRANCH>`, so on the squash path it prints a warning and *succeeds* on a branch that is no ancestor of the base. Item 1 is the only land check. `-D` is permitted for the two cases item 1 proved merged, and for nothing else.

**Without an observed end of run, defer the cleanup and keep going.** Deferral is not step 6's hold: no `WORK:TRAJECTORY`, no `status:` label, no blocker path. The row stays `merged` and drained (step 8) — cleanup is filesystem hygiene, not a campaign outcome, and blocking the row would post a status label on a closed issue and hold the whole campaign behind one agent that may never stop. Carry the deferred rows in your run output, retry one when its agent's end-of-run notification arrives, and sweep once more before the final report. Nothing is written down — no manifest column, no `status:` label, no state file; `git worktree list` against the merged rows' branches recomputes the paths and branches in seconds, which is what makes storing them unnecessary. The one part that does not recompute is which agent owned a row, and losing it on a restart costs the report a name rather than the cleanup.

Name whatever is still uncleaned in the final report, each row with **the reason it was deferred** — end of run not observed, worktree not clean, or branch did not land. The three are not interchangeable and only the first can resolve itself.

The operator owns them from there, though no longer alone: `$clean-branches` classifies every local branch on push evidence, so a merged worker branch is now something it can collect rather than pass over. Don't read its verdicts off this report: it applies its own rules, not step 6's, and a row you deferred may be collected there, skipped there, or neither. One outcome is certain — a row deferred because its worktree was not clean meets the same reading in the sweep, so it stays yours until the files in it are dealt with. And it will not delete a branch with no evidence it was ever pushed, however thoroughly its commits are in the base; that one only ever goes by hand. Which of your rows fall where is the plan table it prints before its single confirmation — read it for the ignored-file inventory on each removal line, the one loss in the sweep nothing restores.

**Never point that sweep at a checkout while a campaign or a dispatched worker is in flight**, yours or anyone's — that is the constraint it states for itself. It has no liveness signal, and its enumeration is repo-wide, so it reaches worktrees nobody here dispatched. Its own skips are not a second reading of the precondition above — its skill says as much itself — and a worker that has committed and is mid-`push` reads clean whichever way you look. Sweeping while any worker is live therefore removes a worktree its owner is standing in, the failure the observed-end-of-run precondition above exists to prevent, reached by another route. Your rows deferred for **end of run not observed** are the worst case for it, being the ones you could not settle that question on yourself. So keep naming them in the report: the sweep is the operator's move once the campaign is over and nothing is in flight, not a substitute for the report.

## 7. Re-Enqueue New Issues

If triage/fixing surfaced new issues (filed with `gh issue create` and linked), add to manifest queue and loop to step 3. Only enqueue issues **traceable to this batch**. Report each enqueue.

## 8. Done

**Drained** means every row is `closed`, `merged`, or `blocked`. End your turn when drained, leaving manifest `active` if any `blocked` rows remain.

A `merged` row is drained whether or not its branch and worktree have been cleaned (step 6). Deferred cleanup never holds a row, never reopens one, and never keeps the manifest `active` — it is reported, not tracked.

**On resume with blocked rows:** revalidate each blocker against its `WORK:TRAJECTORY` note and current state. If resolved, transition to appropriate state (`pending`, `in-flight`, etc.) and continue; if not resolved, leave blocked.

**Issue-local blockers** don't halt the batch. Drain ready work, mark blocked with reason, continue.

**GitHub is the parked state** (github-tracking skill). Who writes the label depends on who parked it:
- **Subagent reported blocker** → it already posted `WORK:TRAJECTORY` and set `status:blocked`/`status:needs-human`. Record `Status: blocked` with reason from report. Don't rewrite label.
- **You block it** (triage inconclusive, merge-phase blocker, orchestrator decision) → post `WORK:TRAJECTORY` note, ensure-create and set label (`status:blocked` for external dependency, `status:needs-human` for human diagnosis).

Ensure manifest row and GitHub state agree before moving on.

Flip manifest to `Status: complete` only when every row is `closed` or `merged`. Campaigns containing `blocked` rows stay `active`.

Report final table: issue → outcome (`closed-already-fixed` / `merged-PR#` / `blocked: reason`) → notes.

List any deferred cleanup alongside it — per row, the branch and the worktree path still on disk, plus the agent whose end of run was never observed where the run still knows it.
