# Scope a GitHub Issue

Estimate the size and risk of issue **#<issue-number>** before any work starts. **Read-only** —
this skill writes nothing to GitHub, git, or the filesystem. Its output feeds
`$work-issue` and `$issue`'s decomposition.

## Steps

1. **Resolve repo.** `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner` → `owner/name`;
   pass `--repo <owner/name>` on every `gh` call.
2. **Read the issue.** `gh issue view <issue-number> --repo <owner/name> --json
   title,body,labels,comments`. Follow any linked issues/PRs named in the body.
3. **Locate the implicated code.** From the issue's nouns and any `file:line` references,
   use `Grep`/`Glob` to find the files and modules the change would touch. Do not guess
   beyond what the text and code support.
4. **Assess and report** (to the user only — no writes; the hand-off to `$work-issue` is
   **in-session only**, since nothing is persisted for a later session or a dispatched
   subagent to read):
   - **Blast radius** — the files/modules affected, and whether the change is local or
     cross-cutting.
   - **Risk flags** — call out any of: migrations, auth/permissions, public API/contract,
     concurrency, data loss/irreversibility, external services. "none" is a valid result.
   - **Complexity** — `S` (one or two files, no contract change), `M`, or `L` (broad or
     cross-cutting).
   - **Decompose verdict** — "one PR" or "split", and if split, a proposed sub-issue
     breakdown a human can act on.

## Hard constraints

- Read-only: no `gh issue edit`, no comments, no labels, no branches, no file writes.
- Explicit `--json` fields on every `gh` read.
- Ground every claim in the issue text or the code you actually read.
