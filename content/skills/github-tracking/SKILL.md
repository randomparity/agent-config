# GitHub Tracking

Pipeline state lives on GitHub, not in the conversation: a single-active `status:` label
per issue, and structured `WORK:*` annotation comments. Any future session (or a human)
resumes for the price of one `gh` query. Conventions adapted from the ForgeDock protocol
spec (CC-BY-4.0); rewritten here, nothing copied.

## Label state machine

One `status:` label is active at a time. Every transition removes all other `status:`
values in the same `gh issue edit` call.

```
needs-triage → ready → in-progress → in-review → awaiting-merge → (issue closed)
                  ↘ blocked / needs-human   (reachable from any state)
```

| Label | Hex | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `status:needs-triage` | `ededed` | not yet analyzed |
| `status:ready` | `0e8a16` | triaged, eligible for work |
| `status:in-progress` | `fbca04` | a session is implementing |
| `status:in-review` | `1d76db` | adversarial review of the branch running; a PR may not be open yet |
| `status:awaiting-merge` | `5319e7` | green + mergeable; human just clicks merge |
| `status:blocked` | `b60205` | external dependency |
| `status:needs-human` | `d93f0b` | pipeline cannot proceed; human must diagnose |

Rules:

- **Closed = terminal, and closed-state is authoritative.** There is no `status:done`
  label. Any reader treats a *closed* issue as done regardless of a lingering `status:`
  label — GitHub closed-state wins. A closed issue may briefly still carry
  `status:awaiting-merge` after a human UI-merge until `$recover-orphans` strips it; that
  window is expected and harmless.
- **`awaiting-merge` ≠ `needs-human`.** The first needs zero diagnosis (human just clicks
  merge); the second means a human must investigate. Never conflate them.
- **`blocked`/`needs-human` exit edges.** A human clears them by re-running `$work-issue N`
  (→ `in-progress`) or re-triaging (→ `ready`). The workflow that moves an issue *into*
  `blocked`/`needs-human` first posts/updates a `WORK:TRAJECTORY` note recording the parked
  phase and the live branch/PR, so resume knows where it was. The branch/PR are the durable
  anchor a resume rediscovers.
- **One writer per transition edge.** Each edge has a single owning command; different
  commands may write the same value on different edges without racing (`status:ready` is
  produced by `$triage-issues`, `$issue`, and `$recover-orphans` on three distinct edges).
- **Epics are outside the state machine.** Issues labeled `epic` never carry a `status:`
  label — their state derives from their sub-issues. `$triage-issues`, `$campaign`
  selection, and `$recover-orphans` skip `epic`-labeled issues entirely.
- **Birth-blocked entry edge.** `$issue` decompose mode may create a sub-issue directly
  in `status:blocked` with a `Blocked by #<n>` body line recording an ordering
  dependency, and `$epic`'s adoption path may move an adopted sub-issue onto the same
  edge (posting a `WORK:TRAJECTORY` note first if the adoptee was in-flight). The
  `Blocked by` line is the parked-state record in lieu of a `WORK:TRAJECTORY` note;
  `$recover-orphans` treats an open blocked issue carrying it as correctly held while any
  blocker is open or cannot be resolved. Exit is the canonical cleared-dependency edge
  below; explicit `$triage-issues` and `$work-issue` remain manual fallback edges.
- **Cleared-dependency exit edge.** An open, non-epic issue carrying `status:blocked` moves
  to `status:ready` only when its body has at least one canonical whole-line
  `Blocked by #N` record and every referenced issue resolves closed. `$merge-cleanup` is
  the primary owner after a verified merge and closure. `$recover-orphans` owns the same
  repair edge behind its plan-and-confirm gate. A canonical line is case-sensitive, has no
  leading or trailing content, and contains decimal digits after `#`. A line beginning
  exactly `Blocked by #` but failing that grammar is malformed and holds the issue blocked;
  other prose and every comment are ignored. Open, missing, malformed, or unreadable
  references fail closed and produce an actionable report.

### Recipe: reconcile cleared dependencies

Source `assets/cleared-dependencies.sh` (deployed with this skill) in Bash, never in zsh;
the array and regular-expression behavior is intentionally Bash-specific. Then call
`reconcile_cleared_dependencies plan <owner/name>` to print the repair set without writes,
or `reconcile_cleared_dependencies apply <owner/name>` to perform the primary post-merge
edge. Recovery passes the confirmed issue numbers after the repository name so apply mode
cannot widen the approved plan. GitHub's REST pagination is exhaustive; do not replace it
with the bounded default of `gh issue list`. The apply path re-reads each dependent and its
blockers immediately before its single status-label edit, then verifies the result. The
state machine's one-writer-per-edge rule serializes supported workflow writers; the readback
detects a conflicting status write. A degraded read or write returns nonzero after every
dependent has been evaluated, so callers can report partial success accurately.

### Recipe: ensure-create a label (distinguish already-exists from real failure)

A workflow must not assume a `status:` label exists. Before a transition, ensure-create the
labels it writes. A bare `2>/dev/null || true` is WRONG — it masks a no-scope failure as
success. Distinguish:

```bash
ensure_label() { # name hex description
  local err
  if ! err=$(gh label create "$1" --color "$2" --description "$3" 2>&1); then
    case "$err" in
      *"already exists"*) : ;; # benign
      *) echo "cannot create label $1: $err — grant the token label-write scope, or run $triage-issues to bootstrap" >&2; return 1 ;;
    esac
  fi
}
```

If ensure-create returns non-zero, the calling command stops with that message rather than
proceeding label-less.

### Gotcha: filtering issues by a `status:` label

`gh issue list --label "status:in-progress"` silently returns nothing — `gh` does not
percent-encode the colon when building the REST `labels=` param, so GitHub matches nothing.
(Single-issue `gh issue edit --add-label`/`--remove-label` with colon labels works fine;
only the *list* filter is affected.) Passing several `--label` flags is worse — GitHub ANDs
them, and an issue only ever carries one `status:` value, so the result is always empty. To
select issues by `status:` value, filter **client-side** after listing by state — the
reliable default:

```bash
gh issue list --repo "$REPO" --state open --json number,labels --limit 500 \
  --jq '.[] | select(any(.labels[].name; startswith("status:"))) | .number'
```

Or use `gh search issues --repo "$REPO" "label:status:in-progress"` (unquoted), which
resolves the colon correctly.

## Risk dimension

How expensive a change is to undo, judged from the issue at triage or birth. It gates
**unattended** work only — it says nothing about daytime eligibility, which `status:` owns.
This section is the single definition; `$triage-issues` and `$issue` assign against it and
reference it rather than restating it.

| Label | Hex | Build unattended | Merge unattended |
|---|---|---|---|
| `risk:night-safe` | `2da44e` | yes | yes |
| `risk:night-watch` | `bf8700` | yes | no — stops at `status:awaiting-merge` |
| `risk:daytime-only` | `a40e26` | no | no |

### What the boundaries gate on

Two properties, and **neither is the likelihood of being wrong** — adversarial review
carries that, and `priority:` does not carry it either. The taxonomy bounds the *cost* of
being wrong; review bounds the *chance* of it. A change that is revertible, isolated, and
test-decided takes `night-safe` however likely the implementation is to be wrong.

1. **Reversal cost** — if this is wrong, what does undoing it take?
2. **Whether correctness can be established with no human in the room.** An unattended
   action has nobody to look at it, so the actor needs a signal it can act on. Green CI is
   such a signal only where the tests decide the question; where correctness is judged by
   eye, green means the suite passed. Isolation belongs here: a cross-cutting change's
   coverage does not extend to the consumers of the contract it changes, so green CI
   cannot decide it either.

### Criteria

- **`risk:night-safe`** — *all of*: reversible by `git revert` alone; isolated, with no
  cross-cutting contract depending on the behavior being changed; and decided by automated
  tests, so green CI is positive evidence rather than the absence of a red.
- **`risk:night-watch`** — still reversible by `git revert` alone, but *any of*: touches
  shared code; changes an external contract (published API, schema, file format, an
  artifact another repo consumes); is user-visible presentation judged by eye; or has
  coverage that does not establish correctness, **including none at all**. Absent coverage
  is the ordinary new-feature case and the case where green CI means least — it must not
  fall through the rubric.
- **`risk:daytime-only`** — *any of*: a data migration or other persisted-data change;
  money, billing, or quota; deletion or retention; auth, permissions, secrets, or the
  threat model; a reversal needing more than `git revert` (deploy-order dependency, manual
  backfill, third-party state change); or an implementation that **writes external state or
  spends a credential while being built**, even when its diff reverts cleanly. That last
  clause is the only criterion aimed at the build rather than the landed change, and it is
  what keeps a test provisioning a live sandbox account out of `night-safe`.

Rules:

- **Multi-match → most restrictive. No match → the most restrictive bucket the change could
  plausibly occupy, never `night-safe`.** The failure costs are asymmetric — over-restriction
  loses a night's throughput, under-restriction ships an unattended irreversible change — so
  this is a floor, not a best guess. Both halves are needed: the criteria are prose, not a
  partition, so a multi-match rule alone leaves an unplaced change with no value at all.
- **Single-active**, with the same swap semantics as `priority:`/`status:` — every
  transition removes all other `risk:` values in the same `gh issue edit` call. A **consumer**
  that nonetheless finds more than one value takes the most restrictive present. A human can
  add a second label in the UI at any time, and a queue predicate that positively matches
  `night-safe|night-watch` would otherwise be *satisfied* by an issue carrying both
  `daytime-only` and `night-safe`.
- **Absence is a third state and never a default.** No `risk:` label means *not yet judged*,
  which is not `night-safe`. Every consumer fails closed: an unlabeled issue is never
  eligible for an unattended action, and no consumer may skip that presence check. Absence
  does **not** force `status:needs-triage` — that state governs daytime eligibility, and this
  judgment gates only unattended work. Unjudged issues are surfaced by `$triage-issues`'
  report line instead.
- **Epics carry no `risk:` label**, for the same reason they carry no `status:` label — they
  are PRD holders, and their sub-issues are the workable units.
- **The three values are never served by an adopted equivalent.** They are a contract read by
  literal name: created under their exact names, or the dimension is absent.

### The human-read invariant

**No `risk:` value reaches GitHub without a human seeing it**, and a `night-safe` or
`night-watch` proposal shows the reasoning that produced it. This is stronger than "sits
behind a confirmation" — a confirmation the value does not appear in is not a read of the
value, so an assigning path whose confirmation does not display it leaves the slot
unassigned instead.

A bare label gives the operator nothing to disagree with, and a confidently wrong
`night-safe` is typographically identical to a correct one. So a proposed `night-safe`
states which of its three conjuncts the assessment judged satisfied and on what evidence
from the issue text; a proposed `night-watch` states its evidence for reversal by
`git revert` alone and names any `daytime-only` criterion that was in contention.
`daytime-only` is exempt — it authorizes nothing, so waving one through costs a night's
throughput and nothing else.

## Annotation convention

Structured reports posted as ordinary issue/PR comments, wrapped in HTML-comment markers.
Durable across sessions and compaction; queryable by text match; invisible in rendered
Markdown except the body.

```markdown
<!-- WORK:TYPE -->
## <Type> — issue #N
<structured body, short labelled bullets>
<!-- TYPE:COMPLETE -->
```

- The `TYPE:COMPLETE` sentinel distinguishes a finished annotation from a comment whose
  write died midway. A block without its sentinel is treated as absent.
- **Latest-complete-wins.** The *last* complete block of a given type on the issue/PR is
  authoritative; earlier same-type blocks are superseded history. Writers append a fresh
  complete block — no read-modify-delete race.
- **Whole-line-anchored matching.** Markers match only as an entire line (`^<!-- WORK:TYPE
  -->$`). A fenced code block containing the string must not false-match.

| Type | Posted on | When | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WORK:SCOPE` | issue | after scoping, before building | blast radius, risk flags, complexity (S/M/L), decompose verdict |
| `WORK:REVIEW` | PR | right after the PR is created | verdict, findings count, iterations, security-review status |
| `WORK:TRAJECTORY` | issue | at the terminal hand-off, and before parking an issue at `blocked`/`needs-human` (exit-edges rule above) | outcome or parked phase, branch/PR #, guardrail status, what a human must decide or supply, surprises worth remembering |
| `GROOM:STALE` | issue | when `$groom` first marks an issue `stale`, one grace period before it closes it | how long the issue has been quiet, the date the sweep will close it, and how to keep it open |

### Recipe: post an annotation

Never inline-interpolate the body into the shell; write a temp file. Never `eval` argument
tokens.

```bash
post_annotation() { # kind(issue|pr) number type bodyfile
  # bodyfile already contains the full block incl. <!-- WORK:$3 --> ... <!-- $3:COMPLETE -->
  gh "$1" comment "$2" --body-file "$4"
}
```

### Recipe: read the latest complete annotation of a type

```bash
gh issue view "$N" --json comments \
  --jq '[.comments[].body | select(test("(?m)^<!-- WORK:TRAJECTORY -->$") and test("(?m)^<!-- TRAJECTORY:COMPLETE -->$"))] | last'
```

Swap `issue`→`pr` and the type name as needed. `last` implements latest-complete-wins.

### Recipe: read a label's application time (staleness)

`gh issue view --json` carries no label timestamp. Use the REST timeline:

```bash
gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/$N/timeline" --paginate \
  --jq '[.[] | select(.event=="labeled" and .label.name=="status:in-progress")] | last | .created_at'
```

Empty result = **stale-unknown**: do not act on age; surface for a human.

## Cross-issue linking

- **PR → issue:** `Closes #N` in the PR body. On a non-default base branch (no auto-close),
  the merging command closes the issue explicitly.
- **Decomposition:** native GitHub sub-issues, not comment-emulated parent/child links.
  File a new child directly with `gh issue create --parent <N>` (needs `gh` ≥ 2.94.0, which
  added sub-issue/hierarchy support). On older `gh`, or to link a pre-existing issue, use
  `gh api repos/<owner>/<name>/issues/<N>/sub_issues` or the `sub_issue_write` MCP tool.
  Keep a human-readable `Part of #N` line in the sub-issue body as a courtesy; the native
  link is the source of truth.
