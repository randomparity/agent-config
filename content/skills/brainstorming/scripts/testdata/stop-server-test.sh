# bites under the locale a developer actually runs, not under whichever one this
# suite inherits. Pin a territory UTF-8 locale where the host has one. `C.UTF-8`
# is deliberately not accepted as a substitute: it does not reproduce the
# collation behaviour, so a case that settled for it would pass while the defect
# was live (ADR 0023). With no such locale the accented id is rejected whatever
# the grammar, so the case still passes -- it just stops proving the property.
