# Design First

Tighten the design before writing code. Defects are cheapest to fix in the
spec, then the plan, then the source. This covers the full design phase:
spec + ADR, adversarial review of the ADR, adversarial review of the spec,
implementation plan, adversarial review of the plan.

Skip this entire command only for a trivial bugfix (all acceptance criteria
clear; no API, schema, auth, permission, concurrency, migration, dependency,
persistence, or external-service behavior changes; touches one or two files;
no new public contract).

If the user supplies an issue number, read it with `gh issue view <issue-number>
--json title,body,labels` for requirements and acceptance criteria.
Otherwise, work from the session context or ask the user what to design.

If you are running as part of a larger workflow (e.g. `$work-issue`),
`BASE_BRANCH` and guardrail commands should already be recorded from
`$preflight`. If running standalone, discover them first: read `AGENTS.md` /
`AGENTS.md`, find the default branch (`gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef`),
and identify the repo's check suite.

**Caller contract.** If invoked inside `$work-issue`, completing this step
means proceed to the next step — do not end your turn. Stop only on a genuine
blocker you have named.

## External scope authority

Use a complete caller-supplied charter unchanged. It contains `interaction`, `scope
identity`, `outcome`, `completion criteria`, `provenance`, `exclusions`, `surface`, and
`ambiguities`. A reviewed or generated artifact is never a substitute for a missing field.

An interactive direct invocation freezes its quoted request into all eight fields.
An unattended direct invocation without a complete charter parks before design.

For a direct human invocation, establish `interaction: interactive`. Before freezing, ask
one question at a time about any omission or conflict that could change a charter field or
normative guarantee. Record the quoted request, answers, and their provenance; use an
explicit empty value when no exclusion or ambiguity exists. An unattended caller must
supply every field. Missing, incomplete, or unresolvable input returns `SCOPE CHECKPOINT`
or parks and never derives authority from a spec, ADR, or plan.

A normative guarantee is a promise that downstream implementation or review must preserve.
Each guarantee must cite a frozen requirement, a later explicit user decision, or a
necessary consequence.

An explicit user decision may authorize a guarantee only when provenance records it.

No reasonable implementation can satisfy the sourced completion criterion without it.

Treat that sentence as the boundary for a necessary consequence. Contestable necessity
returns `SCOPE CHECKPOINT`; review cannot settle it by adding a promise.

High-risk examples begin with transactions, persistence, concurrency, and recovery.
Migrations and new public contracts are also high-risk examples. An explicit sourced
request can authorize any of them; the list is not a blanket ban.

## 1. Spec + ADR

Pass the complete charter to brainstorming without changing root interaction:

interaction: <unchanged root value>
scope identity: <external scope identity, never reviewed target>
outcome: <frozen external outcome>
completion criteria: <frozen external completion criteria>
provenance: <external source for every outcome, criterion, and user decision>
exclusions: <frozen external exclusions>
surface: <frozen permitted surface>
ambiguities: <frozen ambiguity list>

Only the frozen external charter and its provenance satisfy dispatched approval gates.

Use `brainstorming` first if the design space is wide. **You are its dispatched
caller** — its *Dispatched mode* section applies: the frozen external charter and
its provenance satisfy the approval gate, step 3 below replaces its User Review
Gate, and it returns the spec to you rather than invoking `writing-plans` itself,
which would skip steps 2 and 3. The issue body remains evidence used while freezing
the charter, not a second live authority source. Say so when you invoke it. Write or
update the design doc under `docs/superpowers/specs/`. For
decisions with viable alternatives — layer boundaries, interface or ownership
splits, concurrency invariants, failure contracts, migration sequencing,
rollback strategy — write or update an ADR under `docs/adr/` with:

- Status
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences
- Considered & rejected

That list selects on the **kind** of decision, never its size, and it stays that
way: a decision with viable alternatives earns a record even when it is small,
because a decision with no record is worse than a record that is too long. Never
skip the ADR to keep it short — what scales to the decision is the record's length.

Size the record to what the decision governs, not to how much could be said about
it. The five sections above are the whole of it: enough context that a reader knows
why the question arose, the decision, the consequences that reader would otherwise
discover the hard way, and each rejected alternative with the sentence or two that
sank it. A 57-line record can settle the shape of an entire command; that is the
norm, not a terse outlier. A record running longer than the artifact it
governs has stopped recording the decision and started defending it; a 514-line ADR
over a 19-line state machine is the failure this bounds. State the decision and stop.

Use the orchestrator-assigned ADR number if you were given one (from
`$preflight` step 6); otherwise take the next free number. Link the ADR from
the spec. Run the relevant doc guardrails and commit the spec/ADR.

An ADR-producing change should touch **only its own ADR file**. A hand-maintained
index table serializes parallel ADR PRs on one merge conflict — N such PRs cost
O(N²) resolutions, because git conflicts on adjacent insertions even when the
assigned numbers are disjoint. If a repo keeps such an index anyway, add your row
only on a **solo** run; on a **dispatched** run (an orchestrator handed you an ADR
number, `$preflight` step 6) write only the ADR file and report `index row pending`
in your completion report, leaving the row to the orchestrator.

**CI gating the index outranks that split**: the row is a merge
precondition there, and run type is only a convention. `$preflight` step 4 reports the
coupling verdict — and separates checks CI hard-gates **individually** from ones
reachable only through an umbrella recipe, since only the former can block a PR. Under
`$campaign` the verdict reaches you in your dispatch prompt rather than being yours to
rediscover. Where such a check enforces one index row per ADR file, the
withheld row keeps the PR red and the orchestrator's post-wave append never runs,
because the gate blocks the merge that would trigger it. Add your own single row
there, dispatched or solo, and say so in your completion report instead of reporting
`index row pending`. Match neighbouring rows in length and tone and touch no other
row — and give the row's `Status` cell the same value as the record's own `## Status`
section, since a guard that couples the two usually compares them. That agreement is
also why a supersession has to update the row in the same PR wherever changing a
record's status changes that keyword.

If the ADR supersedes an existing one, add a one-line banner to the superseded
record's `## Status` section — `> **Superseded by [NNNN](NNNN-slug.md)**
(YYYY-MM-DD)` — and leave the rest of that file untouched. That banner is the only
edit a merged ADR permits, and it is where a reviewer learns the decision no longer
governs; `$challenge` reads it as a decisive supersession signal.

### AI surfaces require an eval plan

If the change adds or modifies an AI surface — an LLM call, prompt or system
message, retrieval path, classifier, agent loop, tool-use chain, or model
config — the spec is incomplete without an eval plan. No eval plan, no
proceeding to implementation. (Adapted from `suede-ai-eval`,
JasonColapietro/suede-creator-skills, MIT.)

Add to the spec:

1. **AI-SPEC paragraph** — one paragraph stating: user, trigger, input,
   output, allowed sources, disallowed behavior, fallback behavior,
   latency/cost budget, and success signal. Cases written without this test
   nothing.
2. **Failure-mode map** — seed from the surface's system type, then add
   product-specific modes:

   | System type | Canonical failure dimensions |
   |---|---|
   | RAG / retrieval | context faithfulness, hallucination, answer relevance, retrieval precision, source citation |
   | Multi-agent | task decomposition, handoff correctness, goal completion, loop detection |
   | Conversational | tone, safety, instruction following, escalation accuracy |
   | Extraction / structured output | schema compliance, field accuracy, format validity |
   | Tool-using agent | safety guardrails, tool-use correctness, cost/token adherence, task completion |
   | Content generation | factual accuracy, voice, originality |
   | Code generation | correctness, safety, test pass rate, instruction following |

   Score each mode's severity: 5 = legal/financial/privacy/security or
   irreversible user harm; 4 = user-visible wrong outcome on a core workflow.
3. **Eval cases** — every severity-4/5 failure mode gets a concrete case:
   stable id, input, setup/fixtures, observable pass traits, forbidden
   traits, and a gate (block / warn / monitor). An uncovered severity-5 mode
   blocks the design. Minimum case mix: a happy path proving the intended
   value; an ambiguous input that should clarify or fall back safely; a
   forbidden claim or unsafe instruction that must be refused; stale or
   conflicting source data; a permissions/privacy boundary; an expensive or
   looping behavior with a hard cap; and a regression fixture for any real
   observed failure.
4. **Measurement per dimension** — prefer code-based checks (schema, required
   fields, thresholds) that run in CI. An LLM judge counts as evidence only
   after spot-checked agreement with a human-reviewed sample; a model grading
   its own output is not evidence.

The eval cases are acceptance criteria: `$build-tdd` implements them as
tests alongside the feature, not after it ships.

### Security-relevant changes require a threat model

If the change is security-relevant — it moves what an untrusted actor can reach
or cause, touches authn/authz or tenancy, handles a secret, parses input it did
not produce, builds a command/query/path/URL from a non-literal, widens a
permission grant, or changes dependencies or security-relevant defaults (the
same trigger `$work-issue` step 6 applies to the diff, judged here on intent
because no diff exists yet) — the spec is incomplete without a threat model.

Add to the spec:

1. **Boundary inventory** — every point where data or control crosses a trust
   level in the design: what enters, from whom, under whose control. Name the
   boundaries the design *adds* and the existing ones it *widens*, separately.
2. **Actor model** — who the untrusted parties actually are for this deployment
   (anonymous internet, authenticated tenant, another service, a local operator,
   a CI job). A control is only meaningful against a named actor; "an attacker"
   is not one. State plainly where the design places its trust, because an
   unstated trust assumption is the one nobody revisits.
3. **Control per boundary** — for each boundary, the check that governs it:
   validation, authorization, bound, encoding, and what it leaks on failure. A
   boundary whose control is "the caller already checked" names that caller and
   the guarantee it makes.
4. **Explicitly out of scope** — the threats this design does not address and
   why (accepted risk, covered elsewhere, not reachable in this deployment).
   Silence reads as coverage; an omission stated is a decision, and an omission
   unstated is a gap someone finds later.

Prefer an existing control to a new one, and say which existing guardrail covers
a boundary when one does — a design that re-implements a check the platform
already enforces adds surface without adding safety.

The controls are acceptance criteria: `$build-tdd` implements them alongside the
feature, and `$threat-scan` checks the branch against this inventory at step 5.
A boundary listed here with no control in the diff is a finding, which is the
point of writing it down first.

## Design-review scope input

Every ADR, spec, and plan review receives the same frozen external charter:

interaction: <unchanged root value>
scope identity: <external scope identity, never reviewed target>
outcome: <frozen external outcome>
completion criteria: <frozen external completion criteria>
provenance: <external source for every outcome, criterion, and user decision>
exclusions: <frozen external exclusions>
surface: <frozen permitted surface>
ambiguities: <frozen ambiguity list>

Pass this complete carrier unchanged to every ADR, spec, and plan review-loop call.

The target remains evidence for review, never a source of authority. If a design-changing
ambiguity appears, end the current review cycle and use `SCOPE CHECKPOINT`; do not let the
reviewer resolve it by extending the target.

## 2. Adversarial-review the ADR

If step 1 wrote or updated an ADR, harden it as a review target **before** the spec
review, so the spec review is not leaning on an unreviewed decision. Detect the
ADR(s) this design produced with a git predicate — not your recollection of whether
step 1 wrote one, which a post-compaction resume loses. The changed-ADR set is the
union of:

- target-repository path: `git diff --name-only <BASE_BRANCH>...HEAD -- docs/adr/ ':(exclude)docs/adr/README.md'`
  — ADRs already committed on the branch, and
- target-repository path: `git status --short --untracked-files=all -- docs/adr/ ':(exclude)docs/adr/README.md'`
  — ADRs written but not yet committed (`--untracked-files=all` so a brand-new,
  never-staged ADR is seen regardless of the user's `status.showUntrackedFiles`
  config).

The target-repository `':(exclude)docs/adr/README.md'` pathspec drops the index — an index-row edit is
not an ADR to challenge. **Echo an audit line before proceeding** —
`ADR review: changed-ADR set = <paths, or empty> → reviewed | skipped` — so a
mis-evaluated predicate leaves an inspectable trace rather than silently reopening
the F7 shield (the repo's only verification is reading the transcript). **If the set
is empty, skip this step** and continue to the spec review — most designs record no
ADR, and an empty set is the common case. Do not invoke `$review-loop` with a
missing path: `$review-loop` appends a `CHARTER` block on every invocation, and under
a charter an unresolvable target is a hard error naming the token, with `--out`
suppressing both the artifact and the compact object — the loop gets no verdict and
stops as blocked. So the skip must happen here, at the call site.

For each ADR path in the set, run `$review-loop` in file-list mode:

- challenge_args: `<path-to-adr.md>`
- focus: `Focus on the soundness of the decision under its stated context; the
  completeness and honesty of the "Considered & rejected" list — alternatives
  dismissed too quickly, or not considered at all, including the null "do nothing"
  option; unstated or understated consequences and residuals; and whether a simpler
  decision would meet the same context. Size is in scope: a record arguing for its
  decision at greater length than the decision governs is a finding, and its remedy
  is cutting rather than more text. This ADR file is the review target, not settled
  ground — challenge its decision on the merits.`

Do **not** pass the spec/plan reviews' "don't reopen settled ADR choices" focus
here: it would tell the review to treat its own target as settled and neuter it.
Editing the ADR to address findings is legitimate — it is pre-merge on the design
branch, and `AGENTS.md`'s immutability applies only once the ADR is merged. If the
loop blocks (5 iterations without `approve`), stop as blocked per `$review-loop`'s
stop contract; do not run the spec review against an unhardened ADR.

## 3. Adversarial-review the spec

Run `$review-loop` with:

- challenge_args: `<path-to-spec.md>`
- focus: `Focus on hidden assumptions, vague or unfalsifiable success
  criteria, missing edge cases, and under-specified failure modes. If the
  spec covers an AI surface, also challenge the eval plan: failure modes
  without cases, unmeasurable pass traits, and uncalibrated LLM-judge
  evidence. Do not reopen choices already settled in linked ADR rejected
  alternatives unless the spec contradicts them or introduces a new risk.`

## 4. Implementation plan

Pass the same complete charter and root interaction to `writing-plans`:

interaction: <unchanged root value>
scope identity: <external scope identity, never reviewed target>
outcome: <frozen external outcome>
completion criteria: <frozen external completion criteria>
provenance: <external source for every outcome, criterion, and user decision>
exclusions: <frozen external exclusions>
surface: <frozen permitted surface>
ambiguities: <frozen ambiguity list>

Use `writing-plans` to write the plan under
`docs/superpowers/plans/`, derived from the hardened spec. **You are its
dispatched caller** — its *Dispatched mode* section applies: it skips the
Execution Handoff ask and returns the plan path, because `$build-tdd` picks the
execution mode. Say so when you invoke it. The next phase
(`$build-tdd`) may hand tasks to context-free implementer subagents, so every
task must be self-contained:

- full task text
- where the task fits in the issue
- files likely touched
- acceptance criteria a reviewer can check
- relevant repo conventions and guardrail commands
- rollback or cleanup expectations when applicable

Run relevant guardrails and commit the plan.

## 5. Adversarial-review the plan

Run `$review-loop` with:

- challenge_args: `<path-to-plan.md>`
- focus: `Focus on phase ordering, missing prerequisites, steps that cannot
  run in the claimed order, rollback and cleanup paths, verification gaps,
  and tasks that are not self-contained enough for an implementer. Do not
  reopen choices already settled in linked ADR rejected alternatives unless
  the plan contradicts them or introduces a new risk.`

## Context checkpoint

The spec, ADR, and plan you just wrote are the **durable artifacts** of this
phase — they, not the brainstorm transcript or the review payloads, are what a
downstream build (or a post-compaction resume) reads. Before handing off, ensure
the checkable facts a resume needs — the branch name, `BASE_BRANCH`, and the
guardrail commands — are recorded somewhere durable, and, as a reminder, that the
spec/ADR/plan hold every design decision. Do **not** run `context compaction` proactively;
just keep the artifacts complete.
