# Prints the repository's tracked shell sources, one per line (NUL-separated
# with -z). A tracked file is a shell source when its name ends in .sh or its
# first line is a Bash shebang, which covers extensionless executables such as
# scripts/pre-push-hook and the sdd-workspace helpers. The lint, format-check,
# and format recipes consume this list, so wiring a new script into the gates
# requires no recipe edit — the coverage gate ADR 0026/0032 mandated existed
# only because the recipes listed files by hand.
#
# --tabs (default) prints the sources formatted at the repository default.
# --two-space prints the subset formatted with `shfmt -i 2`:
#   - content/skills/brainstorming/scripts/ is vendored two-space, and ADR
#     0005's re-vendor review pays for the upstream diff, not a reformat;
#   - .github/scripts/ and its byte-identical twins under
#     content/skills/decision-records/assets/ are two-space;
#   - statusline.sh and find-polluter.sh predate the format gate at two-space
#     and stay that way to avoid an unrelated full-file reformat.
# --all prints both subsets. Either subset list fails closed when empty: an
# empty inventory means discovery broke, not that nothing needs checking.
