# ripgrep applies .gitignore, .ignore and .rgignore while walking, and it applies
# them to tracked files too. `git add -f` on an ignored path produces a file that
# is in the index -- it ships to everyone who clones this public repo -- and that
# the walk below never opens, so the gate prints nothing and exits 0. That is a
# false green on exactly the content this gate exists to catch.
#
# --no-ignore would close it by disabling ignore handling wholesale, but it also
# pulls in ignored files that are *untracked* and therefore never ship: on this
# host that is CLAUDE.local.md, .agent/campaigns/ and .superpowers/sdd/, five
# files whose whole purpose is to hold host-specific identity out of the tracked
# tree. Turning those red would fail every local `just verify` and every commit
# through the pre-commit hook.
#
# Naming the tracked files instead scans what ships and nothing else: ripgrep
# searches a path given explicitly on the command line whatever the ignore rules
# say, so this covers every ignore mechanism rather than .gitignore alone. On a
# tree with nothing hidden it is the same set the walk already covers.
#
# `git ls-files` reports the index, so a tracked file deleted from the worktree
# and not yet staged names a path with nothing behind it. There is no content to
# scan there, and the status check below would otherwise turn every such tree
# into a fault, so those paths are dropped before the scan rather than after.
#
# The test is -f, not -e: the walk only ever opened regular files, and naming a
# path explicitly makes ripgrep open whatever is there. A tracked path replaced
# by a FIFO blocks the scan forever with no writer, which is a burned CI timeout
# rather than a wrong answer, but the walk-only shape never had it. -f drops a
# dangling symlink and a directory substitution in the same breath.

# --text: ripgrep judges a file binary on one NUL byte and skips it while

# UTF-16, garbling ASCII so these ASCII patterns cannot match. Both are one line
# of file content to trigger, and this gate's subject is content someone may be
# trying to get past it. The trade in --encoding none -- a file genuinely stored
# as UTF-16 stops being scanned -- is accepted in record 0051: no tracked file
# here is one, and a documented five-byte bypass is the worse half.
#
# ripgrep exits 2 for a scan it could not complete -- an unreadable file, a path
# it was handed that it cannot open, an argument list too long for exec -- and it
# does so even when it also found matches. Read as a boolean, that is "no match":
# the gate would print a secret to stdout and still exit 0. A bare `if` here is
# what made a plain `rm` of any tracked file turn this gate green. The sibling
# gates branch on the status for the same reason (check-skill-layout.sh:486,
# check-shared-standards.sh), so this one does too: 0 is a finding, 1 is clean,
# anything else is a fault that stops the run.
